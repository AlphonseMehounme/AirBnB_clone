# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Concepts
For this project, we learned about these concepts:

- Python packages
- AirBnB clone

## Background Context

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

This project will help us : 

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

Requirements


## Execution
This implementation works like this in interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

 Documented commands (type help <topic>):
?========================================
EOF hel quit


(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
?========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
?========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
